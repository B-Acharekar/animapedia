# 🧬 Animapedia

**Animapedia** is a Pokédex-style encyclopedia for exploring Earth’s biodiversity — from animals and insects to plants and fungi. Built with HTML, Tailwind CSS, and JavaScript, it uses the [iNaturalist API](https://api.inaturalist.org) to deliver real-time, searchable data with filters and pagination.
